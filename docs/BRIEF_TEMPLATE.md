## What we want
An online wishlist database for clothing that updates with sale and stock prices. 

## Users
Laptop/Desktop/Phone Browser
Can be accessed daily
Accessibility: increase text size, text to speech, icons and images


## Must do   (numbered; each one testable)
1. Create User Profile with Log in feature
2. Store items and their links
3. Organization feature for stored items (such as folders)

## Should do   (if time allows)
- Clothes recommendation for the users.
- Alert when size is in stock
- Alert when item is on sale
- Compare prices across multiple vendors

## Constraints
- Platform / technology: Three HTML pages (login,  explore, and MyClothes), no backend, no build step
- Data: Stored locally; pulls price information from websites
- Cost: any AI feature must cost less than $0.01
- Accessibility / privacy / legal: No personal identifiable information should be stored


## Out of scope (so nobody builds it by accident)
-Password encryption, synching devices, making recommendations

## Quality expectations
Include unit-testable logic kept separate from the page display code.

## Acceptance criteria
- Saving an item of clothes adds it to MyClothes
- MyClothes is organized by clothing item or style
- Shows the price across different sellers

## Open questions
We do not know the official price, but live updates may increase the cost per request over a static database
